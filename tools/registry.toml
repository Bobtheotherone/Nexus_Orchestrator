# tools/registry.toml — tool allowlist and version pinning
#
# File: tools/registry.toml
# Last updated: 2026-02-12
#
# Purpose
# - Curated list of approved tools and pinned versions for deterministic installs inside sandboxes.
#
# What should be included
# - Tool entries with pinned versions (and ideally hashes) plus provenance (PyPI, apt, github release).
# - Risk classification (low/medium/high) to drive sandbox policies.
# - License notes if relevant.
#
# Functional requirements
# - Tool Provisioner must be able to read this file and install tools reproducibly.
# - Changes must be audited in the evidence ledger (who/why/when).
#
# Tool allowlist — pinned versions for reproducibility
# Add entries as agents request new tools.
