Purpose
- Defines canonical ID formats and helpers (requirement IDs, constraint IDs, work item IDs, run IDs).

What should be included in this file
- ID naming conventions and validation rules.
- Collision avoidance strategy (UUIDv7, ULID, etc.).
- Human-friendly short IDs for UI.

Functional requirements
- Must validate IDs and reject malformed ones early.

Non-functional requirements
- IDs must be stable across restarts and persisted.
