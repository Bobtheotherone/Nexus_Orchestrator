File: src/nexus_orchestrator/planning/architect_interface.py
Last updated: 2026-02-11

Purpose
- Defines how the Architect Agent communicates its decomposition to the orchestrator.

What should be included in this file
- Expected structured output format (machine-parseable) for: module graph, interface contracts, work items, ADR suggestions.
- Validation rules before accepting architect output.

Functional requirements
- Must be strict: reject outputs that lack coverage or violate ownership rules.

Non-functional requirements
- Format must be easy for LLMs to follow reliably.
