nexus-orchestrator — module skeleton

File: src/nexus_orchestrator/verification_plane/adversarial/__init__.py
Last updated: 2026-02-11

Purpose
- Adversarial verification: independent tests and reviews to catch issues implementers miss.

What should be included in this file
- Adversarial test generator integration.
- Adversarial reviewer integration.
- Policies for which work items require adversarial checks.

Functional requirements
- Must ensure separation: adversarial generator doesn't reuse implementer rationale.

Non-functional requirements
- Must keep costs bounded and avoid redundant testing.
