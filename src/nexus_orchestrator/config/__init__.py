File: src/nexus_orchestrator/config/__init__.py
Last updated: 2026-02-11

Purpose
- Config package: parsing, validation, profiles, defaults, and schema versioning.

What should be included in this file
- Public config types and loader function docs.
- Boundary: no provider calls here.

Functional requirements
- Must support loading from orchestrator.toml + env var overrides.

Non-functional requirements
- Must provide clear error messages; fail fast on invalid config.
