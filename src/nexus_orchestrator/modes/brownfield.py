"""
Brownfield mode — repository already exists.

Behavior:
- Indexer scans existing code, infers module boundaries, maps existing tests.
- Constraint Registry built incrementally from existing enforcement (lint rules, CI checks).
- Work items focus on safe refactoring, adding constraint coverage, new features.
- Architect Agent proposes boundary adjustments and interface stabilization.
- Extra care: preserve existing functionality (regression tests mandatory).
