"""
nexus-orchestrator — module skeleton

File: src/nexus_orchestrator/__init__.py
Last updated: 2026-02-11

Purpose
- Package root. Defines public package-level metadata and import boundaries.

What should be included in this file
- Package docstring describing NEXUS orchestrator at a high level.
- Version export and minimal public API surface (keep small).
- Import boundary rules: avoid importing heavy submodules at import time.

Functional requirements
- Must not have side effects at import time (no config loading, no logging init).

Non-functional requirements
- Must keep import time fast (<100ms typical).

Key interfaces / contracts to define here
- __all__ definition for public symbols (once implementation exists)
