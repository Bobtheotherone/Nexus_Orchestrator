nexus-orchestrator — module skeleton

File: src/nexus_orchestrator/utils/__init__.py
Last updated: 2026-02-11

Purpose
- Shared utilities (filesystem helpers, hashing, concurrency primitives) used across the codebase.

What should be included in this file
- Keep utils small and well-tested; avoid dumping ground.

Functional requirements
- Must not introduce cyclic dependencies.

Non-functional requirements
- Prefer standard library where possible.
