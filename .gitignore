# .gitignore — local artifacts to exclude from Git
#
# File: .gitignore
# Last updated: 2026-02-11
#
# Purpose
# - Keep ephemeral artifacts (caches, workspaces, evidence bundles) out of version control.
#
# What should be included
# - Python build artifacts, virtualenvs, caches.
# - Orchestrator-specific: workspaces/, evidence outputs (optionally), logs/, .cache/.
# - State DB file(s) if you treat state as local (recommended for private usage).
#
# Non-functional requirements
# - Do NOT ignore the source-of-truth constraint registry or docs.
# - Prefer ignoring generated evidence artifacts while keeping schema/docs committed.
