# .env.example — environment variable template (NO SECRETS)
#
# File: .env.example
# Last updated: 2026-02-11
#
# Purpose
# - Document which environment variables the orchestrator expects.
# - Provide a safe template that can be copied to .env locally.
#
# What should be included
# - Provider API key variable names (values blank).
# - Optional overrides for paths, concurrency, log levels.
#
# Functional requirements
# - Must never include real secrets.
# - Must be sufficient to run in mock/offline mode without any keys.
#
# Environment variables for provider adapters.
# NEVER commit real secrets. Copy to .env and fill in.
# The orchestrator references these by name, never inlines them.
