# operator_profile.toml — personalization profile (example)
#
# File: profiles/operator_profile.toml
# Last updated: 2026-02-11
#
# Purpose
# - Encode your preferences as structured data so the orchestrator can:
#   - bias planning/decomposition
#   - bias provider/model routing
#   - bias tool selection and dependency policy
#   - apply consistent style/architecture expectations
#
# Rules
# - NO secrets here (no API keys).
# - Preferences should never weaken 'must' constraints.
